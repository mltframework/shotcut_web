### Higher Bit Depth: 10-bit Video CPU Pipeline

What is "bit depth?" That is the number of colors or video brightness levels. 8-bit has only 256 values per color component, for example, red/green/blue. 10 bits has 1024 levels. Previously, 10-bit video sources were only partially supported using **GPU Effects** and only GPU filters. Without GPU Effects (CPU), in order to stay in thee 10 bit space, you could only use filters with the `#10bit` tag but no transitions or track blending/compositing. Now, we have ported many CPU video effects to support 10- and 12-bit video sources including transitions and track blending. Also, the `#10bit` CPU video filters also work properly with the experimental GPU processing. Not all of the video CPU filters have been converted; many of them come through another software project that does not support it. However, we were able to convert many for this release or at least mark them as safe for a 10-bit project.

### Higher Image Quality: Linear Color Processing

Any mixing of pixels with a color space's gamma is not ideal, can cause color distortions, and is technically incorrect. This pixel mixing occurs whenever images interpolated, for example scaling, blurring, and sub-pixel positioning, as well as with track blending/composition. Previously, only **GPU Effects** and video filters in the **GPU** category operated in linear color. Now, there is an option to use it outside of the GPU processing. But when using the GPU, the handoff of the video from GPU to CPU now stays in the linear color transfer.

There is a new sub-menu in **Settings > Processing Mode** with options:
  - **Native 8-bit CPU (fast, flexible)**
  - **Native 10-bit CPU (slower, better)**
  - **Linear 10-bit CPU (slowest, best)**
  - **Linear 10-bit GPU/CPU (Experimental)**

Non-linear "native" options are still included because there is a signficant performance decrease when using linear (more conversions). We have a plan to improve performance for the next release. 8-bit is still included because it is more "flexible" by including more video filters. Of course, you can use an 8-bit video filter in a 10-bit, but the quality of the video clip or track will suffer a reduction in bit depth.

- Added **Minimize Shotcut** and **Record Audio** to **Screen Snapshot** and **Screen Recording**.
- Added support for nvenc to **Screen Recording** on Linux/X11.
- Added support for mov_text and SSA in **Properties > Extract Subtitles**.

### Changes

- Changed the default for **Settings > Timeline > Automatically Add Tracks** to OFF (changed in v25.10). 
- Changed the preset folder for the HTML generator to `presets/HTML`.
- Changed the VP8/9 WebM presets to offer greater control over quality and bitrate.
- Changed **New > Animation (Glaxnimate)** to **Drawing/Animation** to clarify that this is not only for animation.
- Changed **New Project > Project name** to not permit `?` to fix unloadable project.
- Changed the **Opacity** video filter's maximum to 200% to support reducing translucency.
- Improved VA-API hardware encoder compatibility on our Linux AppImage, Portable, and Snap builds.
- Changed **Screen Snapshot** on macOS to show a toolbar to choose rectangle or fullscreen and whether to minimize.
- Removed **Screen Recording** on Windows 10--Snipping Tool does not support it.
- Upgrade zimg (used to convert HDR to SDR and to and from linear color) to  version 3.0.6.
