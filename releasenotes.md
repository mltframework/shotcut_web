These are brief notes about known problems and feature additions. See
[News]({{ "/blog" | prepend:site.baseurl }}) or the [git
log](https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/commits/master) for more
information.

##### Release 25.10.31

- Fixed export with '&' in the file path or name.
- Fixed alpha channel decoding Ut Video with alpha channel.
- Fixed starting the Linux AppImage if AppImageLauncher is installed.
- Fixed **Rejoin with Next Clip** duplicates filters.
- Fixed advanced keyframes for **Text: Rich**.
- Some under-the-hood changes in preparation for further end-to-end 10-bit processing on the CPU,
  but the user visible effect in this version is a different set of blending modes in track properties
  and the **Blend Mode** video filter.
- Changed **Export > Search** to include file name extension.
- Changed **Export > Export File** to **Export Video/Audio**.
- Changed **Settings > Time Format** to default to **Clock**.
- Changed **Settings > Timeline > Adjust Clip Gain/Volume** to default OFF.
- Changed **Settings > Timeline > Automatically Add Tracks** to default ON.
- Added a **Text: Typewriter** video filter.
- Added **Open With** and **Reload** to **Properties**.
  - You can think of this as "Edit With" especially useful for images and audio files.
  - There is a file watcher upon opening with another tool as long as selection (Properties) does not change. If it does, you can use **Reload**. This does not yet reload--whether manual or automatic--every clip object based on this file.
- Added **Text to Speech** to **Notes** and **Subtitles**.
  - This uses Docker as like a plugin framework. The engine for this is Kokorodoki, and the model is Kokoro--both of which are not made by us. Do not ask us for more languages or voices.
  - There are Docker installers for Windows and macOS from docker.com. For Linux, it is usually preferable to get it from your distribution but ensure you get the real docker and not podman or the desktop icon dock bar. On Debian-based systems, it is the `docker.io` package.
  - The quality with subtitles is heavily dependent upon the timing and duration of each item. If it sounds choppy or cut-off, you either need to increase the speech speed and/or the item durations. Also, multi-line subtitle items are discouraged because that introduces a pause as it thinks it is like a new paragraph.
- Added **New > Screen Snapshot** and **Screen Recording**.
  - Not yet available for Flatpak on Linux. 
  - These simply invoke `screenshot` on macOS and *Snipping Tool* on Windows. On Linux, it uses bundled ffmpeg on X11; on Wayland, it uses GNOME Shell, KDE Spectacle, or `obs` if neither of those.  
  - On macOS and Linux, Screen Recording starts a Shotcut job in **View > Jobs**. To stop recording right-click the job and choose **Stop This Job**.
  - On Windows, Screen Recording does not create a job or automatically open the capture file. You need to either configure Snipping Tool to save to a file or click the notification that appears to view it from which you can save it. Then, you need to manually locate it and open it in Shotcut using either **File > Open**, the **Files** panel, or drag-n-drop from Explorer.
- Added **New > Image/Video from HTML**.
  - This requires Google Chrome or Chromium.
  - I could not get Microsoft Edge to work even though it is based on Chromium; they changed the headless command line launch behavior enough such that is not clear how to get it working.
  - Please see the stock **Presets** for testing and examples.
  - The stock presets also demonstrate a template facility for up to 3 lines of text. Technically, you can substitute any piece of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript with this except it will not be obvious to a user that a line, for example, corresponds to a color or size and its special format.
  - It is designed to make it easy to copy from codepen.io, but Shotcut does not include pre-preprocessors for things like SCSS or TypeScript. Therefore, in codepen.io click the <kbd>V</kbd> button in the top right corner of the edit block to choose **View Compiled** before copying.
  - This does not support WebGL, and it might not support video either.
  - **Generate Video** is limited to 15 frame-per-second for performance reasons. A somewhat modern or fast computer and SSD hard drive are recommended.
  - Generate automatically opens the result in the **Source** viewer so you can preview it with its HTML input still in place. Once you add it to **Playlist** or **Timeline**, **Properties** now reflects the image or video and no longer shows the HTML inputs.
- The minimum Linux glibc version increased for this release to 2.35 (Ubuntu 22.04).
- Upgraded to FFmpeg 8.
- Upgraded librarues: SVT-AV1, libaom, dav1d, libvpx, libwebp, and whisper.cpp.


##### Release 25.08.16

- Fixed **Gain/Volume** filter from a previous version project does not show its UI or keyframes (broke in v25.07).

- Fixed dropdown menus using **Settings > Theme > System** on Windows.
- Improved the **System** theme to follow the operating system palette.
- Added **Settings > Theme > System Fusion** that combines the operating *system* palette with the monochrome, symbolic icons of the *Fusion* themes.

  * Downmix
  * Equalizer: 3-Band
  * Equalizer: 15-Band
  * Equalizer: Parametric
  * Expander
  * Gain/Volume
  * High Pass
  * Low Pass
  * Limiter

- Added hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to ripple-trim when **Ripple** is turned off.
- Added **French (Canadian)** and **Lithuanian** translations.

##### Release 24.10.29

- Removed the **Export > Video > Resample** button. Now, there are simply ignorable inline warnings when making certain changes.
- Added **Subtitles > menu > Speech to Text**:
  - This uses AI, but we did not make it. It uses a C++ port of [OpenAI Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/) called [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp).
  - Expect there to be occasional errors. Like humans and non-ideal conditions; it is not perfect. We will not take action on bug reports about some piece of audio not converting to the expected text.
  - Our builds include a basic model that has decent speed and accuracy but not a big size. (You can think of the model as the brain.)
  - You can download a bigger and better better brain (model) in `ggml` format and configure it in the **Speech to Text** dialog, but it will be slower.
  - The dialog creates two jobs that appear in the **Jobs** panel: one to export audio and another to convert to text.
  - The results are added to the **Subtitles** panel as a new top-level Subtitle Track.
  - Currently, the only GPU our build supports is Apple Silicon. Otherwise, it is heavily multi-threaded on the CPU.
  - Known quirk: subtitle items sometimes start earlier than expected.
- **Transition** improvements:
  - **Ripple Delete** a transition restores the entirety of the clips included in the transition.
  - **Lift** (non-ripple delete) a transition no longer leaves a gap; the gap is filled with the adjacent clips.
  - Moving an adjacent clip can now adjust the transition duration.
  - Known bug: Using **Undo** after any of the above disconnects the transition from its adjacent clips and returns future operations around the transition to the old behavior.
  - The only way to get the old behavior is to first drag the transition to an empty area of another track. Ripple mode should be on if you want ripple delete. Or, simply accept the new behavior and adjust things as needed.
- Added **File > Show Project in Folder** to menu.
- Added a `decimals <number>` option to numeric keywords in the **GPS Text** video filter.
- Changed **Recent Projects** to **Projects**: items in this view no longer disappear as **Recent** reaches its maximum length and old items are removed.
- Added a **Remove** action to the context menu in **Projects**.
- Fixed crash opening a project containing a subtitle track with no items.
- Fixed a crash doing when doing more than one **Playlist > menu > Add Selected to Slideshow**. In theory, this could fix other random crashes in **Timeline**.
- Fixed odd value for computed width in **Reframe** output video filter causes export to fail.
- Fixed **Reframe** visual control can create odd-valued dimensions.
- Fixed making a proxy video for a iPhone 16 Pro video containing spatial audio.
- Fixed AVCHD video frame rate is double (could fix other formats).
- Fixed GPU filters paste below non-GPU filters.
- Fixed **Slideshow Generator** dialog is too tall with vertical video mode.
- Fixed **GPS Offset** would reset in **GPS Text** video filter.
- Fixed the maximum allowed **Time** in the **Time Remap** filter to prevent white frames.
- Hide the **Reframe** video filter and button if **GPU Effects** is on.
- Upgraded FFmpeg to version 7.1.


##### Release 24.09.13

- Fixed seeking and frozen video with some files or scenarios.
- Fixed **Reverb** audio filter missing on Windows.
- Fixed wrong frame rate for Android Camera videos.
- Fixed may fail to launch on macOS 11 (build v24.09.19, broke in v24.06).
- Fixed some issues with **Timeline > Clip > Apply Copied Filters**.
- Fixed keyframes are added when not intended in **Color Grading** video filter.
- Fixed color in **Export > Presets > stills > JPEG** preset.
- Fixed audio-only WMA file with DTS audio not playing.
- Added **Increase Text Size** and **Decrease Text Size** to the context menu for **Notes**.
  You can also use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with the mouse wheel.
- Added a **Reframe** video filter (**Output** only) and **Export > Video > Reframe** button.
- Added **Export > Video > Resample** with warning dialog to enable the oft-misused export video resolution, aspect ratio, and frame rate fields.
- Added a warning dialog when changing **Settings > Video Mode** or **Timeline >  Output > Edit** with a project open.
- Upgraded MLT to version 7.28.0.


##### Release 24.08.29

- Fixed the Linux portable, AppImage, and Snap fail to launch on some systems (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04) with Qt 6 and Wayland.
- Fixed 59.94 fps in Matroska falsely identified as variable frame rate (broke in v24.06).
- Fixed mono audio assets not playing through both stereo channels (broken in v24.06).
- Fixed **Open Other > Audio/Video Device > Video Input** on macOS (broke in v24.06).

- Fixed many audio filters missing for Windows on Arm computers (broke in v24.06).
- Fixed setting the audio language in **Export > Other** using `alang=`.
- Fixed right <kbd>Alt</kbd> key (AltGr) for text input in some languages instead keyboard shortcuts/actions in Windows.

- Fixed **Add Keyframe at Playhead** for some filters, for example **Color Grading**.
- Fixed enabling keyframes in **Color Grading** adds 2 keyframes.
- Fixed the modal font dialog on Linux can be behind main window making Shotcut not responsive.
- Fixed occasional audio pop/click with some media files especially with uncompressed audio.
- Fixed lag in **Filters > search**.
- Fixed a disabled **Crop: Circle** or **Crop: Rectangle** video filter becomes enabled when reselected.
- Fixed the `hevc_toolbox` hardware video encoder fails detection on some Intel Macs.
- Fixed file dialogs open slowly in the Linux AppImage.
- Fixed overriding **Properties > Rotation** on a proxy video whose default is not 0 exports with wrong rotation.
  This bug affected the creation of the proxy and thus requires making a new proxy, which is easier said than done on Windows due to file locking. **Properties > Proxy > Disable Proxy** on the affected clips is a workaround if you do not turn off proxy completely.
- Fixed **Properties > Proxy > Make Proxy** does not override a DJI- or GoPro-provided proxy video.
- Now <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> in **Filters > search** changes focus to the search results.
- Now <kbd>Up</kbd> or <kbd>Down</kbd> in **Help > Actions and Shortcuts > search** changes focus to the search results.
- Changed the **Softness** to 0 in the **Obscure With Blur** and **Obscure With Mosaic** filter sets.
- Added a **Power (W)** ( `#gps_power#`) field to the **GPS Text** video filter.
- Added **View > Subtitles**.
- Added **Subtitle Burn In** video filter (only works on **Output** track).
- Added **Export > Other > Disable subtitles** checkbox.


##### Release 24.06.26

- Improved handling for some variable frame rate videos. Now, it tries to show the file's target frame rate and extends the variable detection logic to include strange average frame rate values (what previous versions showed).
- Changed **Playlist Tiles** view mode to show Date instead of In/Start.
- Fixed using graphics (text, image, etc.) on upper video track with GPU Effects.
- Fixed an off-by-one frame bug in the duration for Glaxnimate animations.
- Fixed **Undo** does not work for time filters.

- Fixed **Export > Codec > Quality** hint not updated after changing **Rate control**.
- Fixed **Properties > Proxy > Make** does not regenerate if already exists.
- Fixed changing **Properties** (except **Speed**) affects clips on other tracks with **Ripple All Tracks** turned on.
- Fixed drag from **Source** and drop to **Source** changes **Playlist**.
- Fixed **Automatically Add Tracks** changes the current video track, which can cause unexpected behavior with **Properties > Speed** change, for example.
- Fixed files generated automatically in the project folder (.stab, .rawr, etc.) are incorrectly generated in the app data's `autosave` folder in the app session immediately after Shotcut recovers an auto-saved project.
- Fixed changing **Properties** can delete a timeline clip.
- Fixed selected filter changes unexpectedly by changing tabs or clicking filter categories.
- Fixed **Properties > Audio > Track > All**.
- Fixed the project folder when running an autosave-recovered session.
- Fixed **Settings > Timeline > Auto Add Tracks** creates too many tracks when drop multiple clips to **Timeline**.

- Fixed **Properties > menu > View Bitrate** hiding the first second.
- Added support for DJI LRF (MP4) files as a proxy.
- Added **Playlist > menu > Columns**.
- Added SVT-AV1 encoder (faster non-hardware AV1 encoder).
- Added the **Mid-Side Matrix** audio filter for processing these kinds of microphones into proper stereo sound.
- Added a **Drop Shadow** video filter that uses the input alpha channel. (This means that it will not work as expected when used after a text filter on a video clip; rather, you must use a text clip on an upper track.)
- Added a **Vibrance** video filter.
- Added support for sRGB in **Properties > Video > Color transfer**.
- Added support for AVIF images.
- Added **Keyframes > Scrub While Dragging**.
- Added native build for Windows on Arm64 CPU.

##### Release 23.11.29

- Fixed honoring the "Do not show this anymore" checkbox in the **Convert to Edit-friendly** dialog (configuration key `showConvertClipDialog`) (broke in v23.09).
- Fixed the new batch convert dialog (**View > Resources**) appeared instead of the old **Convert to Edit-friendly** one when dragging a *single* concerning clip to **Playlist** or **Timeline** (broke in v23.09).
- Fixed **Motion Tracker** filters are forgotten upon switching to **Source** player (broke in v23.09).

- Fixed AMD (AMF) quality options in a saved **Export** preset shows up in the **Other** tab overriding **Codec > Quality**.
- Fixed **Timeline** appears all white on Qt 6.6.
- Fixed libvpx security vulnerability CVE-2023-5217.
- Fixed libwebp security vulnerability CVE-2023-4863.
- Added **Crop:Rectangle > Apply to Source** button.
  This button is only enabled when the aspect ratio of the source media matches your project's **Video Mode** because it is impossible to include the black padding that Shotcut adds to a source. This feature is the primary way to simply "crop a video." You do not need to use the timeline for this. You can simply:
  1. set **Settings > Video Mode** to **Automatic**,
  1. open a video file,
  1. add the **Crop: Rectangle** video filter,
  1. adjust the rectangle control in the player,
  1. click **Apply to Source** in the **Filters** panel,
  1. choose **Yes** in the dialog asking to change the **Video Mode**, and
  1. **Export**.
- Added **Opacity** to **GPS Text**, **Text: Simple**, and **Timer** filters.
- Improved performance of **Timeline > Zoom**.
- Added rectangular selection to **Timeline**.  
- Added **Settings > Timeline > Rectangle Select**.  
  This is on by default, and scrubbing with the mouse on the timeline requires clicking near the play head.
  When this is on, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to turn it off temporarily. When this is off, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to temporarily turn it on.
- Changed the **Smooth** keyframe type to avoid overshoots and cusps.  
  This only applies to new projects made with this and future versions. Thus, the behavior of smooth keyframes made with an earlier version remains the same for compatibility reasons.
- Added **Ease In**, **Ease Out**, and **Ease In/Out** to **Keyframes**.  
  This also changes the appearance of keyframes in the timeline view of **Keyframes** to make it more clear where the behavior applies - *between* keyframes. Remember this: when thinking about "in" or "out", for Shotcut "in" refers to the beginning of something - a clip, filter, or parameter between keyframes. And "out" refers to the end of something. So, this is not easing *into* a keyframe and easing *out of* a keyframe. Rather, it is easing *into* or *out of* the change/segment/span/tween of a parameter between keyframes.
- Added **Properties > View Bitrate...**.  
  If you have ever used the classic **Bitrate Viewer** for Windows and frustrated with the lack of updates or not available on your current OS, here you go.
- Added a **Track Auto Fade Video** filter. This can only be added to tracks and makes a dip to black or other color or fade in and out opacity for overlays to each clip.
- Changed **Export > Codec** and **Audio** to disable some options when a lossless-only or an intra-only codec is selected.
- Added **Settings > Timeline > Automatically Add Tracks**.  
  The defaults for this is off because adding tracks increases memory usage. Also, it does not automatically add a track if nothing is in the **Timeline** as the timeline is optional in Shotcut. Also, it does not automatically add a track when you open a project with no empty tracks. It only adds tracks when you add something to the timeline or move a clip between tracks.
- Fixed YouTube export preset is not H.264 high profile with some hardware encoders.
- Fixed a memory leak when using YADIF deinterlacers.
- Fixed color of export from still images when using full range and `pix_fmt=yuv444p`.
- Added a button in **Filters** to save a filter set and change the **Copy checked filters** button to not show a dialog.
- Added **Filters > Set > Glow Intensity**.  
  This demonstrates how you can mix a filtered output with the input to reduce it.
  Also, change the **Mask: From File > Treshold** to do a side-by-side comparison with and without the filter.
- Added **Split at Playhead** back into the timeline clip context menu.
- Changed the **Save** option in the low memory dialog to perform a backup and save to prevent breaking projects.
- Added support for `av1_nvenc` NVIDIA AV1 hardware encoder on Windows and Linux.
- Upgraded MLT to version 7.22.0.

- Changed **Export > Presets > audio > FLAC** to (raw) flac format instead of Matroska.
- Upgraded **Glaxnimate** to version 0.5.4 with limited support for After Effects projects (no plugins and no video or audio media - drawing and image animations only).

- Fixed keyboard behavior of **Help > Actions and Shortcuts** on macOS.
- Improved the quality of **Settings > Proxy > Use Hardware Encoder** on macOS.


##### Release 23.07.29

- Fixed crash on startup on older Windows 10 computers that do not have Direct3D 11 (broke in v23.05).
- Added **Track Auto Fade** and **Track Seam** audio filters. These filters address an old problem where clicks and pops may be heard in export when switching between clips due to discontinuities in the audio stream. A recommended technique was to add a 2 frame Fade Audio Out and Fade Audio in filters on clips. **Track Auto Fade** automates that. **Track Seam** works on a similar level but rather attempts to do a smoothing between outgoing and incoming samples around edit points. Both of these new filters may ONLY be added to individual tracks--audio or video.
- Added **Transition type > Cut** to the **Slideshow Generator**.
- Added <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+Wheel (<kbd>command</kbd> on macOS) to numeric fields to increment and decrement by a larger amount.
- Fixed shift-drag-drop from Windows Explorer to **Playlist** deletes the files! This is an old bug, and Shotcut is not deleting the files. But it accepts a move drop action for the purpose of reordering playlist items. However, doing so with a list of filenames makes Windows assume the receiving application did something appropriate with thes file and then... delete them on behalf of the app just to be sure?!? Smooth move. (Another Windows file manager *Directory Opus* does not exhibit this bad behavior.)
- Fixed another very old bug on Windows where sound does not follow the default output device, for example plugging headphones, until you restart the app. Please note that if you are using **Settings > Audio Channels > 6 (5.1)** after the default sound output changes, you will likely experience distortion in the audio playback until you restart the app.
- Added the `--SDL_AUDIODRIVER` command line option for Windows and Linux.
- Fixed **Timeline** scrubbing and skimming accelerate too much (broke in v23.06).

  - All files in the `transitions` folder are listed in transition **Properties**, the **Mask: From File** video filter,
    and the **Slideshow Generator** dialog.

    the `transitions` folder.

    more easily find things based on proliferic English advice.

    Then, use this path to default save dialogs such as next XML or
    video stabilization data.
-   On OS X, when using System theme, stack the display volume and mute
    toggles so these widgets do not appear so wide.
-   Workaround for the Stabilize filter's analysis job crashing on
    Windows.<br>The analysis job still crashes at the end, but
    the data is still created and usable. So, go ahead and try to use
    the data regardless of the job's failure.
-   Make adjusting image duration on timeline easier.<br>Now,
    the Duration field in Properties adjusts the out point, and the
    actual duration is 10 minutes. This lets you add just a few seconds
    to the Timeline by default but then stretch or shrink the image clip
    on the timeline up to 10 minutes. If you need more than 10 minutes,
    add the clip to the track again.
